But there were even stronger humans, whom after becoming a Stellar Martial Cultivator, continued to train and condense the Astral Qi absorbed from the constellations, unceasingly strengthening the toughness of their bodies, and broke away from the realm of a Stellar Martial Cultivator. They forcefully opened the astral gate within their bodies, enabling them to be able to link with even more constellations, and able to condense more types of different Astral Souls.

Legend has it that the strongest cultivators in the Province of the Nine Skies were beings that could open an astral gate every time they advanced into a new realm. Their talent in cultivation was such that they could even establish innate links with constellations that existed on a higher layer than the Nine Layers of Heaven, eventually transforming into the heaven-defying and earth-shattering powers known as the War Gods within the Nine Layers of Heaven.
